- Hi, I’m @NeilMillikin
- Unlike so many here, I am not an IT guy but instead am an amateur genealogist using digital technology to work with DNA data.
- I am reasonably proficient in a variety of areas related to genealogy and data science, particularly Python and MySQL.
- I can be reached at neil.millikin@gmail.com
